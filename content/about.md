The Greenhorn meeting is a conference held annually, which targets junior researchers (those who are within the first-half
of PhD or in the last year of their masters) working in the research areas of quantum optics, nano optics, atomic physics and
ultra-cold atomic gases so that they share their knowledge and exchange ideas. The aim, in addition to providing an
opportunity to give a talk and present a poster, is to provide a platform for connecting and networking among junior
researchers in their respective fields of research.
